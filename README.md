# csharp
A repository of my learning and experimenting with C\#

Some of the content you will see inside based on folder structure:

1. CSVariables 
  * A basic web tutorial I ran through. Performed the basics behind Windows Forms
2. LinkedListTesting
  * Unit testing for linkedList
3. Menus
  * More basic Windows Forms
4. WindowsFormsTutorial
  * Another Windows Forums tutorial. I wanted to make sure I had a decent grasp over this concept.
5. csharp-number
  * A form that plays with Floating point numbers.
6. csharpconsole
  * A Hello World to C\#.
7. linkedList
  * A linked List class that I'm currently developing. I realize that Collections has a linked list class already, but this is a basic practice for refreshing on data structures.
