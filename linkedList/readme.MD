# Linked List Example

## Why is this even here still?
The linked list has a relatively storied past in my development career. 
When I was a CS student, I could wrap my head around the linked list concept with ease, and I thought that I knew precisely what they were, and how to use them.

However, when it came time for implementation, I learned a critical piece of the puzzle: *sometimes things are harder to do than they are to talk about.* 
That realization, is why I still have this here. 

When I started to develop more seriously, I found that just doing this basic task, which eluded me in application for so long, would be an excellent way to prove to myself that I've come far further as a developer than I gave myself credit for being. 
A previous boss of mine would often remind me that I was better at developing than I give myself credit for. I will still always refute that statement on principle, but this project was the first time that I realized he may have been onto something.

Pushing this code here was the first time that really started to believe I may not actually be a developer imposter.
